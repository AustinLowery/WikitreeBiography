# WikitreeBiography
The program will generate a biography of a person based on a text file containing copied contents from a FamilySearch census record and on information gathered from FindAGrave.com.

The Full Controller makes use of both FindAGrave and the census biography creator. All other controllers maintain their own separate uses indicated on the file name. To copy from FamilySearch, click on "Tools" from the desired census records, click Copy to Clipboard, paste it into "FamilySearchDoc.txt", and continue until all census records are pasted into the text document.
